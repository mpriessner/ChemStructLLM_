# Smiles-TO-iUpac-Translator

## Overview

The Smiles-TO-iUpac-Translator is a specialized tool for converting between SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation and IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) nomenclature. This bidirectional translation tool serves as a critical bridge between machine-readable chemical representations and human-readable chemical names.

## Key Components

1. **SMILES Parser**: Processes SMILES strings into internal molecular representations
2. **IUPAC Generator**: Converts molecular representations to standardized IUPAC names
3. **IUPAC Parser**: Interprets IUPAC nomenclature to extract structural information
4. **SMILES Generator**: Creates valid SMILES strings from molecular representations
5. **Validation Tools**: Ensures accuracy of translations in both directions

## Workflow

1. Input is processed (either SMILES string or IUPAC name)
2. Internal molecular representation is generated
3. Target format is produced through appropriate generator
4. Output is validated for chemical correctness

## Integration

This module integrates with other components in the repository:
- Supports the `LLM_Structure_Elucidator` by providing standardized naming
- Works with outputs from `deep-molecular-optimization` to provide human-readable names
- Can be used as a preprocessing step for any component that requires standardized molecular representations

## Applications

- Standardizing chemical representations across research workflows
- Enabling human interpretation of machine-generated structures
- Supporting documentation and publication of chemical research
- Facilitating database searches across different notation systems
- Enhancing interoperability between different chemical software tools
