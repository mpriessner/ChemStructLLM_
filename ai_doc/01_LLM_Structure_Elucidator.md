# LLM Structure Elucidator

## Overview

The LLM Structure Elucidator is a sophisticated tool that leverages Large Language Models to determine chemical structures from spectroscopic data. This component represents a novel approach to structure elucidation by treating it as a language translation problem, where spectral patterns are "translated" into molecular structures.

## Key Components

1. **Data Processing**: Conversion of spectral data (NMR, IR, MS) into formats suitable for language model processing
2. **Tokenization**: Specialized tokenization schemes for spectral data and chemical structures
3. **Model Architecture**: Adaptation of transformer-based language models for spectroscopic interpretation
4. **Structure Generation**: Methods to generate valid chemical structures from model predictions
5. **Validation**: Tools to validate predicted structures against experimental data

## Workflow

1. Spectroscopic data is preprocessed and tokenized
2. The LLM processes this input and generates structural predictions
3. Post-processing ensures chemical validity of the structures
4. Validation against known structures or additional spectral data

## Integration

This module integrates with other components in the repository:
- Uses utilities from `utils_MMT` for data handling
- Can leverage `nmr_sgnn_norm` for specialized NMR data processing
- Works with `Smiles-TO-iUpac-Translator` to convert between notation systems

## Applications

- Structure determination from complex spectral data
- Assistance for chemists in structure elucidation tasks
- Automated interpretation of spectroscopic results
- Novel compound identification in discovery workflows
