Based on your requirements, here's a step-by-step plan for implementing the Visual Analysis Agent. Let's break it down into manageable steps:

Step 1: Create Basic Agent Structure

Create new file: visual_analysis_agent.py in specialized folder
Define base class inheriting from the same base as tool_agent.py
Add basic initialization and required interface methods
Step 2: Update Workflow Definitions

Add new workflow step constant in workflow_definitions.py
Add the step to the TARGET_ONLY workflow sequence
Step 3: Update Orchestrator

Add handling for the new agent type in orchestrator.py
Ensure proper data flow from previous steps
Step 4: Implement Core Agent Functionality

Add JSON data loading from molecular_data.json
Implement data transformation for LLM analysis
Add LLM service integration interface
Step 5: Add Analysis Logic

Implement spectrum-by-spectrum analysis
Add result aggregation
Create output formatting
Step 6: Integrate with Coordinator

Update coordinator to handle the new agent type
Add necessary communication methods
Let's start with Step 1 - creating the basic agent structure. Would you like me to proceed with implementing that step first?

For Step 1, we would:

Create visual_analysis_agent.py with basic class structure
Add required imports
Define main class methods (init, run, etc.)
Add basic logging and error handling
Would you like me to proceed with implementing Step 1?

Me

Can we actually implement step number one? Yes, but let's call it differently. Let's call it analysis agent because it will draw some inspiration from the tool agent. Please look into this file where the analysis agent will call different analysis tools to execute the analysis, of which some of them will handle the vision capabilities of the LLM to compare different data points, but it will also be presented to data and you should then analyze also the data. So can you implement as a first step this analysis agent within the specialized folder and draw some inspiration on the structure for the tool agent?

Let me first examine the tool_agent.py structure to ensure we follow the same patterns:

Analyzed

tool_agent.py:(1-51)
Let me create a new analysis_agent.py file with a similar structure but focused on analysis capabilities:

Open diff
I've created the basic structure for the analysis_agent.py file. Key features:

Base Structure:
Inherits from BaseAgent like the tool_agent
Has its own set of capabilities focused on analysis
Uses the same logging and error handling patterns
Core Components:
init: Sets up the agent with analysis capabilities and LLM service
run: Main entry point for running analysis tasks
_load_molecular_data: Loads data from the specified JSON file
_analyze_data: Will contain the main analysis logic
_format_results: Formats results for output
Key Differences from ToolAgent:
Focused on analysis rather than tool execution
Built-in handling for molecular data file
Structured for analysis workflow rather than tool coordination
Next steps would be:

Add specific analysis tools to the tools dictionary
Implement the analysis steps in _analyze_data
Add LLM integration for data interpretation
Would you like me to proceed with any of these next steps? Or would you like to review and modify this basic structure first?

Can you look into the coordinator and check whether this one is available to be called from the coordinator and can be selected from the coordinator and then also look into the orchestrator and check whether everything is aligned and within the orchestrator that this tool agent can be used within the orchestrator and also look into the workflow definitions .py file and add this analysis tool as tasks in the target only category to be executed.

I'll check each file to ensure proper integration. Let's start with the coordinator:

Analyzed

coordinator.py:(1-51)
Let me check the workflow definitions:

Analyzed

workflow_definitions.py:(1-101)
Now let me check the orchestrator:

orchestrator.py:(1-51)
Based on my review, we need to make several changes to integrate the Analysis Agent:

Result explanation and validation
Relevant keywords that will help the coordinator route appropriate requests to this agent:
Analysis-related terms
Interpretation-related terms
Validation and comparison terms
Explanation-related terms
This will allow the coordinator to properly identify when a user request should be handled by the Analysis Agent, particularly for tasks involving data interpretation, result explanation, and comprehensive analysis of molecular structures and spectral data.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the capabilities or keywords for the Analysis Agent?

and we now move on to step number three update orchestrator and you check if there are any updates to be made in the orchestrator.py file for handling the analysis tools.

I've made several important updates to the orchestrator:

Added Analysis Agent Integration:
Added analysis_agent property initialized from the coordinator
Added "Analysis coordination" to capabilities
Added check for analysis agent initialization when needed
Updated Process Molecule Method:
Added condition to check if analysis agent is available when needed
Added special handling for analysis steps
When a step is an analysis step, it uses the analysis_agent instead of the tool_agent
Passes both molecule data and previous step outputs to analysis agent
Enhanced Error Handling:
Added check for analysis agent availability
Proper error handling for analysis steps
Data Flow:
Analysis agent gets access to both the current molecule data and all previous step outputs
Results are stored in the same workflow data structure
These changes ensure that:

The analysis agent is properly integrated into the workflow
Analysis steps are handled differently from tool steps
The analysis agent has access to all necessary data
Results are properly stored and tracked
Would you like me to make any adjustments to these changes or shall we move on to the next step?

Can you fix this tool for me or this error? I want the process of the analysis agent be executed with the function called process.

Key improvements:

Better data extraction from task_input
More detailed analysis of NMR matches including:
Total peaks in experimental and predicted spectra
Number of matched peaks
Match ratios
Unmatched peaks counts
Added human-readable summary generation
Proper error handling with metadata
The agent now properly implements the required interface and provides meaningful analysis of the molecular data. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the implementation?

Me

Next, I want to implement step number four, the core functionality of the analysis agent. So something that I was thinking is that if I run the analysis, it should actually run all of the analysis. So this means if the request of the analysis comes from the orchestrator, it should run it from top to bottom, analyzing each analysis that I'm coming up with here. Or from the coordinator directly, which is called from the chat window. There it can run and call different analysis tools individually.And now is how do I structure the logic that it actually calls different analysis tools. So maybe I have one function that is called process which runs all of the analysis steps. And maybe if I run the coordinator I call a different tool that actually identifies the request of the person asking the question. Then executes specifically the analysis that was requested.Now before jumping into the implementation of the process function of the analysis agent, let's first brainstorm what different types of analysis we want to implement.So, one that comes to my mind is basically looking through the sample that we're interested in and searching the three most likely correct molecules based on the HSQC matching results or maybe the overall NMR matching results, so selecting those three molecules and then basically spec on a spectra of the different kinds in comparison with the three molecules and let the LLM decide which one is the best match and argue why.Additionally, there needs to be a central collection point of analysis conclusions, where analysis conclusions are stored for later references.Then another analysis could be or basically this analysis should be done over all four different experimental spectral modalities that are presented to the system.Can you come up with some alternative analysis suggestions?Another analysis could be actually the comparison of the suggested product compared to the suggested target or if the starting material is presented to compare the starting material to the suggested most likely molecule.I think one key function of this script for the analysis agent is a script that is able to extract the necessary data from the master file and digest it in a way that it can be presented to the analysis agent or to the tool of the analysis agent, not overloaded with unnecessary information.And I will need to prepare some prompts that are capable of coping with those requests for different analysis.Can you now take my brainstorming thoughts and structure it in manageable steps that need to be implemented in the code to make it work, as I suggested, and then give me further suggestions on how I could add further analysis steps to the existing system to increase its value and its accuracy for structure elucidation.

Let me organize your thoughts and suggest a structured implementation plan. I'll break this down into core components and then suggest additional analyses.

The DataExtractionTool for managing data access
The base analysis tool structure
The results management system
The main process flow in the AnalysisAgent
Let me know which part you'd like to tackle first!

Me

Below is a structured plan to implement (and later extend) an Analysis Agent that can handle multiple types of post-processing analysis—both when called from the orchestrator (for a full run) and when triggered in an on-demand fashion (for a partial or user-requested analysis).

1. Overall Logic & Agent Structure
Create a new file, e.g., analysis_agent.py.

Define a main class: AnalysisAgent. This class will have:

A constructor (__init__) that sets up any state (paths, references to data, config, etc.).
A process() method for the top-to-bottom run (when orchestrator calls this agent to do all analysis steps).
Utility methods or sub-functions for each distinct analysis type (e.g., analyze_top3_molecules(), compare_material_and_product(), etc.).
Support methods for retrieving or parsing the “master file” (the aggregated data from earlier pipeline steps).
Add an entry in your workflow dictionary if you want the orchestrator to invoke the AnalysisAgent. For example:

python
Copy code
WORKFLOW_STEPS['analysis_agent'] = AnalysisAgent()
You might insert this step after all NMR matching and candidate generation are done.

Also integrate the agent with the Coordinator (the piece that handles chat-based user requests). That means you’ll have a method like handle_user_request(request_type, data) which calls the relevant sub-analysis function in the agent.

2. Proposed Analysis Types
Below are some of the analysis ideas from your brainstorming. You can code them as distinct methods within the AnalysisAgent. Then your process() method can simply call each in turn (or you can call them selectively based on user input).

2.1. Selecting the Top 3 Molecules by HSQC or Overall Score
Goal: From the final candidate list, pick the top 3 by some measure (HSQC matching, overall NMR matching, or a weighted combination).
Implementation:
Method: def analyze_top3_molecules(self, sample_id) -> None:
Retrieve the candidate structures from the master data.
Sort by matching_scores.overall or a specific spectrum’s matching score (HSQC).
Take the top 3.
Possibly store them in self.analysis_conclusions[sample_id]["top3_by_HSQC"].
(Optional) Kick off an LLM-based re-check: “Given these top 3, please describe which is best and why.”
2.2. “Spectra-by-Spectra” LLM Confirmation
Goal: Use the LLM to examine each spectrum type (1H, 13C, HSQC, COSY) for your top 3 molecules and produce a textual argument about which is best.
Implementation:
Method: def analyze_spectrum_llm_comparison(self, sample_id, top_candidates) -> None:
For each spectrum type, build a minimal prompt and ask the LLM: “Which candidate best fits this spectrum and why?”
Collate responses in a data structure.
Potentially produce a single “mini-report” that merges results from all four spectral types.
2.3. Compare Final Suggested Molecule vs. Starting Material or Target
Goal: Show differences in structure or differences in predicted NMR (especially if you want to see how the reaction might have changed certain functional groups).
Implementation:
Method: def analyze_material_vs_product(self, sample_id, starting_material, final_product) -> None:
Retrieve the starting_material SMILES (if available) and the chosen final product’s SMILES.
Possibly highlight how certain ring substituents or functional groups differ.
Summarize (LLM or code-based) the biggest changes in predicted NMR.
Good for QA or checking if a reaction was plausible.
2.4. Central Collection of Conclusions
Goal: Let each analysis step store a “conclusion record” that other steps or the user can reference later.
Implementation:
In your AnalysisAgent, have a dictionary or data structure like self.analysis_conclusions = defaultdict(dict).
Each analysis function can do something like:
python
Copy code
self.analysis_conclusions[sample_id]["top3_selection"] = {
  "selected_molecules": [...],
  "basis": "HSQC matching",
  "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
}
Then, either your process() method or the coordinator can retrieve these conclusions if the user wants to see them.
2.5. Additional Data Extraction or Summaries
Goal: Provide a method that extracts relevant fields from the “master file” (or the final JSON from candidate analysis) and returns only the data needed for each analysis.
Implementation:
Method: def extract_data_for_analysis(self, sample_id) -> dict:
Reads the big data structure.
Returns a clean subset containing candidate lists, spectral data, etc.
Minimizes clutter, so each specialized analysis function gets a consistent input.
3. The process() Method
process(self, sample_id, *args, **kwargs)

This is your top-level function that runs all analysis steps in a sequence if the orchestrator calls it.
Possible structure:
python
Copy code
def process(self, sample_id):
    # 1. Extract data
    extracted_data = self.extract_data_for_analysis(sample_id)

    # 2. Analysis #1: Select Top 3
    top3 = self.analyze_top3_molecules(sample_id, extracted_data)

    # 3. Analysis #2: LLM Spectral Confirmation
    self.analyze_spectrum_llm_comparison(sample_id, top3)

    # 4. Analysis #3: Compare with Starting Material
    if "starting_material" in extracted_data:
        final_candidate = self.pick_final_candidate(sample_id)  # or from top3
        self.analyze_material_vs_product(sample_id, extracted_data["starting_material"], final_candidate)

    # 5. Possibly more analyses...
    # 6. Store or log the final analysis conclusions
    self.save_conclusions(sample_id)
If invoked from the coordinator (the chat interface), you might skip some steps or only run what the user asked for:
python
Copy code
def handle_user_request(self, sample_id, request_type):
    if request_type == "top3_analysis":
        self.analyze_top3_molecules(sample_id, extracted_data)
    elif request_type == "compare_material":
        self.analyze_material_vs_product(sample_id, sm, final_prod)
    ...
4. Suggestions for Additional Analysis
Weighted Scoring Analysis

Let the user or the system weigh certain spectra more heavily. Provide an analysis that re-sorts top candidates based on new weighting factors.
Coupling Pattern Analysis

Instead of only comparing chemical shifts, also compare couplings (doublet, triplet, J-values). An LLM or a deterministic approach can highlight if a coupling pattern is impossible for a given structure.
Functional Group Consistency Check

A quick check that ensures, e.g., if the structure has a carbonyl, we see a peak ~160–220 ppm in ^13C. Flag if missing.
If you have multiple ring substituents, ensure the correct number of aromatic peaks.
Reaction Path Analysis

If you have a reaction from starting material to final product, check each intermediate for plausible spectral changes. Summarize in a final “reaction route NMR consistency” analysis.
LLM-based Contradiction Finder

Provide the LLM with “structure says we have an sp^2 carbon at X but the shift is sp^3 typical.” The LLM flags contradictions. This can reduce guesswork.
Batch Meta-Analysis

If you run multiple samples in a batch, analyze trends: “All these samples show a consistent shift at ~7.2 ppm, does that correspond to a common substructure?”
5. Putting It All Together
Practical Implementation Steps:

Create analysis_agent.py with the AnalysisAgent class.
Add the new agent to your workflow steps, e.g.:
python
Copy code
WORKFLOW_STEPS['analysis_agent'] = AnalysisAgent()
Implement your brainstorming logic:
A process() method that calls multiple sub-analysis methods in the correct sequence (or all at once).
Sub-analysis methods:
analyze_top3_molecules(...)
analyze_spectrum_llm_comparison(...)
analyze_material_vs_product(...)
A central store: self.analysis_conclusions.
A data extraction method: extract_data_for_analysis(...).
Draft the LLM prompts:
“Which of these top 3 molecules best fits the experimental HSQC data, and why?”
“For each spectrum type, highlight mismatches >0.2 ppm in ^1H or >5 ppm in ^13C.”
Add logic so that the Coordinator can call just one sub-analysis if the user only wants that. Or the orchestrator calls agent.process(sample_id) for the full run.
Conclusion
By organizing your new Analysis Agent into well-defined sub-analyses, each having its own data extraction, logic, and (optionally) LLM prompt, you’ll keep the code modular and maintainable. Over time, you can add more advanced checks (e.g., coupling pattern or functional group checks). This approach also ensures the same agent can handle:

Full runs (via process())
User-specific queries (via the coordinator, e.g., “Which is the best molecule for the HSQC data?”)
And each analysis function writes its conclusions into a shared structure for later reference or final reporting.

|Here I have some additional thoughts which I brainstormed with another LLM. Can you combine this idea with your suggestions to provide me a final guideline on how to implement this? Now I break down the steps, step by step, so that I can walk you through each of the implementations and investigate those changes in a transparent fashion.

Let me combine both ideas and break down the implementation into clear, sequential steps. We'll implement this piece by piece, ensuring each part works before moving to the next.

Let's start with Phase 1, Step 1.1. Would you like me to implement the DataExtractionTool first? Here's what I propose for its structure:

python
CopyInsert
class DataExtractionTool:
    def __init__(self, molecular_data_path):
        self.molecular_data_path = Path(molecular_data_path)
        self.cache = {}  # Optional caching for frequently accessed data
        
    async def extract_molecular_data(self, sample_id: str) -> Dict:
        """Extract all relevant molecular data for a sample."""
        
    async def extract_spectral_data(self, sample_id: str, 
                                  spectrum_type: str) -> Dict:
        """Extract specific spectral data."""
        
    async def extract_top_candidates(self, sample_id: str, 
                                   n: int = 3, 
                                   sort_by: str = 'hsqc_score') -> List[Dict]:
        """Extract top N candidates based on scoring criteria."""
        
    async def extract_reaction_data(self, sample_id: str) -> Dict:
        """Extract reaction-related data including starting materials."""
Would you like me to implement this class first, or would you prefer to start with a different component? We can proceed step by step, ensuring each component is working before moving to the next.

|please implement me the data extraction tool. Maybe we could actually implement it for me first as a template.I will need to look into the details later on how exactly I can extract the information from my master file.Maybe we can also give it two options to either load it from the master file including a given sample ID which allows us to retrieve the information of all the previous calculations from the master file or we can use the intermediate calculated file which will be the one that we are operating on when running the orchestrator workflow and we make this distinction for both options to retrieve the information which will be the same regardless because one will have the sample ID to retrieve the molecular data and the other one will have just the key molecular data and then it contains all the same information. Let's make this data loader or data extraction tool flexible with this aspect.Please implement it.

I'll create a DataExtractionTool that can handle both master file and intermediate file scenarios. Let's create this in a new file:

I've created a flexible DataExtractionTool with the following key features:

Dual Source Support:
Can load from master file (molecular_data.json)
Can load from intermediate files (per-sample intermediate results)
Uses an enum DataSource to clearly specify the source
Caching System:
Implements a simple time-based cache (5-minute duration)
Helps prevent repeated file reads
Can be cleared manually if needed
Key Methods:
load_data: Base method to load from either source
extract_spectral_data: Get specific spectrum type data
extract_top_candidates: Get N best candidates sorted by score
extract_reaction_data: Get reaction-related information
extract_analysis_results: Get previous analysis results
Error Handling:
Comprehensive error handling with logging
Clear error messages for missing files/data
Type hints for better code clarity
Flexible Path Management:
Automatically determines paths relative to the tool's location
Configurable file locations through class attributes
To use this tool in your AnalysisAgent, you would do something like:

python
CopyInsert
from .tools.data_extraction_tool import DataExtractionTool, DataSource

class AnalysisAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm_service):
        self.data_tool = DataExtractionTool()
        
    async def process(self, task_input):
        # For orchestrator workflow (using intermediate file)
        data = await self.data_tool.load_data(
            sample_id="sample1",
            source=DataSource.INTERMEDIATE
        )
        
        # For direct analysis (using master file)
        spectral_data = await self.data_tool.extract_spectral_data(
            sample_id="sample1",
            spectrum_type="HSQC",
            source=DataSource.MASTER_FILE
        )
Would you like me to:

Add more specific extraction methods for your data structure?
Modify the file paths or cache duration?
Add additional data validation or preprocessing?
Move on to implementing the next component?
Me

@data_extraction_tool.py#L30-35 Our data is fairly small, so I think I don't need a cache for that.Please remove this functionality and simplify.@data_extraction_tool.py#L40-46 @data_extraction_tool.py#L61-66 @data_extraction_tool.py#L93-97 

@data_extraction_tool.py#L134-171 Can you maybe add a new key to this dictionary, in case if it's the master, it should be within the sample ID as a sub-key, or if it's the intermediate file, it should be in the same hierarchy as the molecule data, or no, it needs to be in the same hierarchy to not get it confused in between the master and the intermediate file. I actually want it to be in the same hierarchy as the molecular data key in the intermediate file and select a good label for this category. It should basically then contain all the analysis steps and the results of the analysis steps within this sample.and create this key in the functions if it is not present yet

I'll modify the DataExtractionTool to remove caching and add consistent analysis results storage. Let me update the file:

Key changes made:

Removed all caching-related code
Added analysis_results key management:
Created in load_data if not present
Consistent structure across all functions
Each analysis result includes timestamp and type
Added save_data method to persist changes to both master and intermediate files
Enhanced analysis results storage:
For candidate ranking:
python
CopyInsert
'analysis_results': {
    'candidate_ranking': {
        'timestamp': '2025-01-15T16:37:23',

        'results': {
            'top_candidates': [...],
            'ranking_criteria': 'hsqc_score'
        }
    }
}
For reaction analysis:
python
CopyInsert
'analysis_results': {
    'reaction_analysis': {
        'timestamp': '2025-01-15T16:37:23',

            'target_molecule': ...,
            ...
        }
    }
}
Would you like me to:

Add more specific analysis result types?
Modify the structure of the analysis results?
Add validation for the analysis results format?
Move on to implementing the next component?

So can you now adjust the analysis agent in a way that it has a process function that works the same way as the process function from the tool agent but it also has a process all function which basically executes all the tools after each other with all the analysis after each other. So one is with an if-else statement where just one individual tool will be executed and the other one will run all sequentially. Can you implement me this logic in the analysis agent as a template? Where I will fill in the more detailed functionalities later and prepare already the templates for the different analysis steps that I have outlined before.

I'll create an updated version of the AnalysisAgent with both individual and sequential analysis capabilities:

I've restructured the AnalysisAgent to support both individual analysis tasks and sequential processing. Here are the key components:

Analysis Types Enum
python
CopyInsert
class AnalysisType(Enum):
    TOP_CANDIDATES = "top_candidates"
    SPECTRAL_COMPARISON = "spectral_comparison"
    REACTION_ANALYSIS = "reaction_analysis"
    STRUCTURAL_COMPARISON = "structural_comparison"
    FUNCTIONAL_GROUP = "functional_group"
    COUPLING_PATTERN = "coupling_pattern"
    CONFIDENCE_SCORING = "confidence_scoring"
    CONTRADICTION_CHECK = "contradiction_check"
Two Main Processing Methods:
process: For individual analysis tasks
process_all: For running the complete analysis pipeline
Individual Analysis Function Templates:
python
CopyInsert
async def _analyze_top_candidates(self, molecule_data, context)
async def _analyze_spectral_comparison(self, molecule_data, context)
async def _analyze_reaction_pathway(self, molecule_data, context)
async def _analyze_structural_comparison(self, molecule_data, context)
async def _analyze_functional_groups(self, molecule_data, context)
async def _analyze_coupling_patterns(self, molecule_data, context)
async def _calculate_confidence_scores(self, molecule_data, context)
async def _check_contradictions(self, molecule_data, context)
Context Passing:
Each analysis function receives the molecule data and context
Results from previous analyses are stored in context['previous_analysis']
Each analysis can access results from previous steps
Error Handling:
Comprehensive error handling at both individual and pipeline levels
Detailed logging for debugging
Consistent error response format
To use this agent:

For individual analysis:
python
CopyInsert
result = await analysis_agent.process({
    'analysis_type': AnalysisType.TOP_CANDIDATES.value,
    'molecule_data': molecule_data,
    'context': context
})
For full analysis pipeline:
python
CopyInsert
result = await analysis_agent.process_all(molecule_data, context)
Would you like me to:

Implement any specific analysis function first?
Add more analysis types to the enum?
Enhance the error handling or logging?
Add additional utility functions?

@analysis_agent.py#L17-35 I think another analysis step that I wanted to do was the comparison of the top candidates to the experimental spectra. So then I not only have the error metrics of the top candidates that are selected by the comparison of the different NMR spectra and its associated error but then also evaluate their likelihood to match the experimental spectra based on an LLM evaluation. Can you add this or would you put this analysis analysis within the top candidate analysis? How would you structure this?

I would suggest adding this as a separate analysis type since it's a distinct evaluation that combines numerical metrics with LLM-based analysis. Let me update the AnalysisType enum and add the corresponding analysis function:

ErrorCascade cannot edit files that have unsaved changes. Please save the file and try again.
I see there are unsaved changes. Let me show you the proposed changes and you can apply them:

Add a new analysis type to the enum:
python
CopyInsert
class AnalysisType(Enum):
    """Types of analysis that can be performed"""
    # Rank and select top candidate molecules
    TOP_CANDIDATES = "top_candidates"
    # Compare predicted vs experimental spectral data
    SPECTRAL_COMPARISON = "spectral_comparison"
    # LLM-based evaluation of spectral matches
    SPECTRAL_LLM_EVALUATION = "spectral_llm_evaluation"  # New type
    # Analyze proposed reaction pathways
    REACTION_ANALYSIS = "reaction_analysis"
    # Compare structural features between molecules
    STRUCTURAL_COMPARISON = "structural_comparison"
    # Identify and analyze key functional groups
    FUNCTIONAL_GROUP = "functional_group"
    # Validate NMR coupling patterns
    COUPLING_PATTERN = "coupling_pattern"
    # Calculate overall confidence scores
    CONFIDENCE_SCORING = "confidence_scoring"
    # Check for contradictions in analysis results
    CONTRADICTION_CHECK = "contradiction_check"
Add the new analysis function:
python
CopyInsert
async def _analyze_spectral_llm_evaluation(self, molecule_data: Dict[str, Any], context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:

    (AnalysisType.REACTION_ANALYSIS, self._analyze_reaction_pathway),
    # ... rest of the steps
]
This approach:

Separates numerical comparison from LLM-based analysis
Provides detailed analysis for each spectrum type
Generates both per-candidate and overall assessments
Maintains context between analyses
Can be run independently or as part of the full pipeline
Would you like me to:

Modify the LLM prompts?
Add more specific analysis criteria?
Adjust how it integrates with other analysis steps?
Add additional validation or error handling?
