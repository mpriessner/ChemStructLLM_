# ChemStructLLM User Guide

## Overview

ChemStructLLM is an AI-powered structure elucidation tool that combines experimental NMR data with large language models to assist in molecular structure determination. This guide will walk you through all the features and how to use them effectively.

## Getting Started

### 1. Starting the Application

Run the application using:
```bash
python app.py
```

The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

**ðŸ“¸ Screenshot needed:** *Main application startup screen*

### 2. Remote Server Access (SSH Tunneling)

If you're running ChemStructLLM on a remote server or cluster node, you'll need to set up SSH tunneling to access the web interface from your local machine.

#### Setting Up SSH Tunnel

1. **Basic SSH Tunnel Setup**
   ```bash
   ssh -L 5000:localhost:5000 username@remote-server.domain.com
   ```

2. **Custom Port Tunneling** (if port 5000 is occupied)
   ```bash
   # Tunnel remote port 5000 to local port 5001
   ssh -L 5001:localhost:5000 username@remote-server.domain.com
   
   # Then access via: http://localhost:5001
   ```

3. **Example for Cluster Access**
   ```bash
   # Replace with your actual username and server
   ssh -L 5001:localhost:5000 your_username@cluster-node-name
   ```

#### After SSH Tunnel is Established

1. **On the remote server**, start the application:
   ```bash
   cd LLM_Structure_Elucidator
   python run.py
   # Application runs on remote localhost:5000
   ```

2. **On your local machine**, open your browser and navigate to:
   - `http://localhost:5000` (if using direct port mapping)
   - `http://localhost:5001` (if using custom port mapping)

#### Troubleshooting SSH Tunneling

- **Port already in use**: Try a different local port (e.g., 5001, 5002)
- **Connection refused**: Ensure the application is running on the remote server
- **Tunnel drops**: Add `-o ServerAliveInterval=60` to keep connection alive
  ```bash
  ssh -L 5001:localhost:5000 -o ServerAliveInterval=60 username@server
  ```
